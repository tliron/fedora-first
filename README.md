Fedora First!
=============

Hi! Have you just installed [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/)? Here are
some scripts to round up the experience for you and fix some annoyances. Specifically they add
some *non-free* and *patented* software, like codecs. So, like, look into them and make sure they
are right for you.

Tested with Fedora 30 and Fedora 29.

Start with `install-extra-codecs` and then add the rest as you please. Or just run `everything`
to get all the goodies.

Also note that `install-extra-themes` currently only installs one theme: the best one,
[Arc](https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-theme). But if you want more choices, check out my
[install-gnome-themes](https://github.com/tliron/install-gnome-themes) script.
